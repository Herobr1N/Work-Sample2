Healthcare Project on Predicting Returning patients Using R
This report is demonstrated by a professional consulting team from the University
of Maryland who focuses on the healthcare industry. All data are collecting and using for
the purpose of predicting patients who are readmitted or return to a hospital within 30
days of being discharged. In the hospital industry, the 30-day readmission rate is one of
the most important measurements about hospitalsâ€™ performances. Therefore, this
information is designed to predict future performance and see whether any hospitals
need to improve their services
